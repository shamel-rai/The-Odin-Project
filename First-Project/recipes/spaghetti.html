    <p>There's nothing like classic spaghetti and meat sauce to bring people together around the dinner table. This
        homemade spaghetti sauce with ground beef recipe will satisfy all your comfort food cravings. </p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</strong></li>
        <li><strong>6 medium green zucchini</strong></li>
        <li><strong>4 ounces spaghetti</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 pinch salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong></li>
        <li><strong>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps for making the Spaghetti</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice
            zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5
            minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let
            zucchini cool to room temperature. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling
            water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10
            minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add
            zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break
            down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break
            zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and
            butter; stir until butter melts. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated.
            Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if
            needed. </li>
        <li><Strong>Step 7:</Strong>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil. </li>
